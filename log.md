Week 1 Plan:
* Basics (Setup Repo, Read CSV, Read from console, EOCI Primitives)

-----
### Day 1: April 26, 2020

**Today's Focus**: Setup github repo and parse CSV files in Java and Python

My answer to a code challenge from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-interview-problem-parsing-csv-files/)

**Details**:

- As I was working on the solution, I wrote unit test while in Python.

- While using Java, I used BufferedReader to read the csv file. I also used myclassName.class.getResource(""")
to determine the full path to a file in the resource folder.
