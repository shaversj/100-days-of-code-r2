### Day 1: April 26, 2020

**Today's Focus**: Reading txt files in Python

My answer to a code challenge from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/06/22-read-from-file.html)

**Details**:

- Explored various ways to read a file in Python

- I used Counter from the Collections module to calculate the number of images in the file.
